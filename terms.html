    <h1>Terms of Use – LockFit</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the LockFit mobile application (the “App”), operated by us (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By downloading, installing, or using LockFit, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country) to use LockFit. By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement and that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>LockFit is a productivity and fitness-focused app that helps you stay consistent by blocking distracting apps and prompting short exercise sessions before unlocking access. Features may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blocking or delaying access to selected apps;</li>
        <li>Exercise challenges and streaks;</li>
        <li>Stats and progress tracking;</li>
        <li>Camera-based exercise or pose detection using QuickPose technology;</li>
        <li>Premium features available through subscription.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may update, modify, or remove features from time to time to improve the App or for other reasons.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
    <p>Certain features of LockFit may be available only through paid subscriptions or one-time purchases (“Premium”).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All purchases for Premium features are processed through <strong>Apple’s App Store</strong>. Your billing relationship is with Apple, not directly with us.</li>
        <li>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage purchases, receipts, and entitlements. RevenueCat helps determine whether your subscription is active and which features you can access.</li>
        <li>Subscription renewals, cancellations, and refunds are governed by Apple’s App Store terms and policies. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time via your Apple ID account settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to change prices or introduce new billing options. Any changes will apply to future subscription periods; existing subscriptions will follow the terms disclosed at the time of purchase until the end of the current billing period.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>By using LockFit, you agree that you will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
        <li>Not misuse the App, attempt to bypass its core functionality, or interfere with its operation.</li>
        <li>Not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
        <li>Not use the App in a way that could harm, disable, or overburden our services or third-party services we rely on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>LockFit encourages you to perform short exercises as part of your unlock flow. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App does not provide medical advice and is not a substitute for professional medical care, diagnosis, or treatment.</li>
        <li>Always consult a doctor or healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have existing health conditions, injuries, or concerns.</li>
        <li>Stop exercising immediately if you experience pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or discomfort, and seek medical advice if necessary.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for assessing whether you are able to safely perform exercises suggested or required by the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using the exercise features in LockFit, you acknowledge and accept that you are doing so at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>LockFit uses several third-party services to provide functionality, analytics, and support:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (by Google):</strong> used for analytics, crash reporting, and cloud services (such as databases or storage) to help us understand performance, fix issues, and improve the App.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> used for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions, validating receipts, and determining your access to Premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>QuickPose:</strong> provides pose detection technology to analyze body movements during exercises and assist in counting reps or checking form.</li>
        <li><strong>FeatureBase:</strong> used for collecting feedback, feature requests, and bug reports so we can improve LockFit over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services are operated by third parties and are subject to their own terms and privacy policies. Your use of LockFit also implies your acceptance of how these third-party services operate and handle data as part of the App experience.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>LockFit, including its name, logo, design, text, graphics, and all related content, is owned by us or licensed to us. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the App solely for your personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.</p>
    <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code, except as permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to LockFit at any time if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms, misused the App, or used it in a way that may cause harm to us, other users, or third parties.</p>
    <p>You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device. Uninstalling the App does not automatically cancel any active subscriptions; you must manage those via your Apple ID account settings.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising out of or in connection with your use of LockFit.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claims arising from your use of the App will be limited to the amount you have paid to us (if any) for use of Premium features during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or the minimum amount permitted under applicable law if higher.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to the App and to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update or modify LockFit from time to time, including by adding or removing features.</p>
    <p>We may also update these Terms occasionally. When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and may provide notice within the App. Your continued use of the App after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Portugal, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Depending on your location, mandatory consumer protection rules of your country may also apply.</p>
