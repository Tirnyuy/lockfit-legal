    <h1>Terms of Use – LockFit</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the LockFit mobile application (the “App”).
        By downloading, installing, or using LockFit, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country) to use LockFit.
        By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        LockFit is a fitness and productivity application designed to encourage movement and reduce distractions.
        However, we do not provide medical advice.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consult your doctor or other qualified health professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have existing medical conditions, injuries, or concerns.</li>
        <li>You use the App and perform any exercises at your own risk.</li>
        <li>Stop using the App and seek medical advice if you feel unwell, experience pain, dizziness, or discomfort.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. License and Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
        We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use LockFit for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App, except where permitted by law.</li>
        <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the App or related services.</li>
        <li>Use the App in a way that could cause harm to yourself, others, or property (for example by exercising in unsafe environments).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions, Billing, and Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        Certain features of LockFit are available only through paid subscriptions or in-app purchases (“Premium”).
        All payments are processed securely by <strong>Apple’s App Store</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prices and available subscription options are displayed in the App Store at the time of purchase and may vary by region.</li>
        <li>Your subscription may renew automatically unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
        <li>Refunds are handled by Apple according to their policies; we generally cannot provide direct refunds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage entitlements and validate subscriptions. RevenueCat receives purchase information from Apple to determine whether you have access to Premium features.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        LockFit uses several third-party services to provide and improve the App:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (by Google):</strong> Used for analytics, crash reporting, and cloud services (such as databases, storage, or authentication if used). This helps us ensure the App is reliable and improves over time.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions, validate receipts, and determine access to Premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>QuickPose:</strong> Used to power AI-based pose detection and exercise tracking using your device’s camera.</li>
        <li><strong>Featurebase:</strong> Used to collect optional feedback, feature requests, and bug reports from users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These third-party services may have their own terms and privacy policies, which you should review. Your use of LockFit implies your acceptance that these services may be involved in providing functionality, as described in our Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        The App and its original content, features, design, and branding (excluding content provided by you) are and will remain the property of the LockFit team or its licensors.
        You may not use our trademarks, logos, or branding without our prior written consent.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Content</h2>
    <p>
        If the App allows you to submit content (for example: feedback, suggestions, or comments), you retain ownership of that content, but you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and display that content for the purpose of operating and improving the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring that any content you submit does not violate the rights of others or any applicable laws.
    </p>

    <h2>8. App Changes, Availability, and Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We may update, modify, or temporarily/permanently discontinue parts of the App at any time, with or without notice.
        We are not liable if the App is unavailable for any reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these Terms or misuse the App.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

    </ul>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all implied warranties, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our total liability for any claims relating to the App shall be limited to the amount you paid (if any) for Premium features during the 3 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or our business.

        In some cases, we may also provide notice within the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your continued use of LockFit after any changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in your country or region of residence, unless otherwise required by mandatory local law.
