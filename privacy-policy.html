    <h1>Privacy Policy – LockFit</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>LockFit</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the LockFit mobile application (the “App”).
        By using LockFit, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We aim to collect only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve the App.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide to us</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account-related information (if any):</strong> If the app allows you to create an account or save preferences, we may collect information such as your name or email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and support:</strong> If you contact us for support or send feedback (for example through in-app forms or via Featurebase), we collect the information you choose to share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>When you use LockFit, we may automatically collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App usage data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the App (e.g. which screens you visit, session length, buttons tapped).</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Such as device model, operating system version, app version, language, and country/region.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification and reminder settings:</strong> For example, your chosen challenge reminders or exercise schedules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is generally collected in an anonymized or aggregated way and does not directly identify you.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Camera usage and pose detection</h3>
    <p>
        Certain features of LockFit may use your device’s <strong>camera</strong> to assist with exercise tracking and pose detection.
        This may be implemented using the third-party service <strong>QuickPose</strong> 
    <ul>
        <li>The camera is used only for the purpose of providing in-app functionality (e.g. tracking your posture or counting reps).</li>
        <li>We do not store raw camera images or video on our own servers.</li>
        <li>Any real-time processing of images for pose detection is handled locally on your device or through the QuickPose SDK, in line with their own privacy practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Notifications</h3>
    <p>
        LockFit uses local and/or push notifications to remind you about planned exercises, focus sessions, challenges, or progress.
        You can control or disable notification permissions at any time in your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the App and its core features (distraction blocking, challenges, exercise tracking, stats).</li>
        <li>Maintain your progress, streaks, scores, and personalization preferences.</li>
        <li>Improve app performance, stability, and user experience.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about important changes, new features, or updates (where applicable).</li>
        <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues, misuse, or security risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>
        LockFit may offer premium features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.
        All payments are processed by <strong>Apple’s App Store</strong>, and we do not store your full payment card details.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We may receive limited information from Apple (such as transaction identifiers or subscription status) in order to unlock premium content and manage your access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We also use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscriptions and entitlements.
        RevenueCat processes purchase-related data for the purposes of validating your purchases, determining whether you are entitled to premium features, and managing active subscriptions.
        For more information, please refer to RevenueCat’s own privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We use third-party services to help us operate and improve LockFit. These services may process data such as device information, usage events, anonymous identifiers, and subscription status, in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (by Google):</strong> Used for analytics, crash reporting, and cloud services (such as databases, storage, or authentication if used in the app). Firebase helps us understand how the app is used, diagnose issues, and improve performance.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions, validate receipts, and determine access to premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>QuickPose:</strong> Used for AI-powered pose detection and exercise tracking via the camera. QuickPose may process pose-related or motion-related data needed to provide this functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Featurebase:</strong> Used as a feedback and feature request tool to collect optional user feedback, bug reports, and suggestions for improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain information only for as long as necessary to provide the App and its features, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
        If you stop using LockFit, we may retain some anonymized or aggregated data for analytics and improvement, but it will no longer be linked to you.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.
        However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>The right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can also:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manage or disable notifications in your device settings.</li>
        <li>Limit certain analytics or tracking via your device privacy settings (where supported).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or have questions about your data, please contact us using the details in the Contact section below.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        LockFit is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country).
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can investigate and delete such information where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on the third-party services we use (such as Firebase, RevenueCat, QuickPose, or Featurebase), your data may be processed in countries other than your country of residence.
        We take steps to ensure that any international data transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your data remains suitably protected.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or technical and business developments.
        When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
