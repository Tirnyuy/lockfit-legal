Privacy Policy – LockFit

⸻

Last updated: November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how LockFit (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the LockFit mobile application (the “App”).

By using LockFit, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

⸻

1. Information We Collect

We aim to collect only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve the App.

1.1. Information you provide to us
	•	Account-related information (if any):
If the app allows you to create an account or save preferences, we may collect information such as your name or email address.
	•	Feedback and support:
If you contact us for support or send feedback (for example through in-app forms or a feedback tool), we collect the information you choose to share.

1.2. Automatically collected information
When you use LockFit, we may automatically collect:
	•	App usage data:
Basic information about how you interact with the App’s features (for example, which screens are viewed, session length, buttons tapped).
	•	Device information:
Such as device model, operating system version, app version, language, and country.
	•	Notification and reminder settings:
For example, your chosen exercise reminders or challenge schedules.

This information is generally collected in an anonymized or aggregated way and does not directly identify you.

1.3. Camera usage
Certain features of LockFit may use the camera to help guide or track your exercises.
	•	The camera is used only for the purpose of providing in-app functionality (e.g., tracking your posture or reps).
	•	We do not store or transmit camera images or video to our servers.
	•	Any processing using the camera happens locally on your device or through the third-party SDKs we use (if applicable), according to their privacy policies.

1.4. Notifications
LockFit uses local and/or push notifications to remind you about:
	•	planned exercise sessions,
	•	challenges,
	•	streaks or progress.

You can control notification permissions at any time through your device settings.

⸻

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
	•	Provide and operate the App and its features (e.g., app blocking, exercise sessions, challenges).
	•	Maintain streaks, progress stats, and your personal settings.
	•	Improve the App’s performance, stability, and user experience.
	•	Communicate with you about updates, new features, or important changes (where applicable).
	•	Detect and prevent misuse, fraud, or technical issues.

We do not sell your personal data.

⸻

3. Subscriptions & Payments

LockFit may offer premium features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.
	•	Purchases and subscriptions are handled by Apple’s App Store billing system.
	•	We do not receive or store your full payment card information.
	•	We may receive limited information from Apple (such as transaction identifiers or subscription status) in order to unlock premium content and manage your access.

We also use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and entitlements. RevenueCat processes purchase information in order to:
	•	validate your purchases,
	•	manage active subscriptions, and
	•	determine whether you have access to premium features.

You can read more about RevenueCat’s privacy practices in their own Privacy Policy.

4. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services to help us run and improve LockFit, such as:
	•	Firebase (by Google): for analytics, crash reporting and app stability.
	•	RevenueCat: for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions.
	•	Feedback / feature tools (e.g., a customer feedback platform) to help collect feature requests and bug reports.

These third parties may process data such as:
	•	device information,
	•	app version,
	•	general usage events,
	•	anonymized identifiers.

Each third party handles data according to its own privacy policy.

⸻

5. Data Retention

We retain information only for as long as is necessary to:
	•	provide the App and its features,
	•	comply with legal obligations,
	•	resolve disputes, and
	•	enforce our agreements.

If you stop using LockFit, we may retain some anonymized data for analytics and app improvement, but it can no longer be linked to you.

⸻

6. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

⸻

7. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:
	•	The right to access, update, or delete information we hold about you.
	•	The right to object to or restrict certain processing.
	•	The right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or have questions about your data, you can contact us using the details in the Contact section below.

You can also:
	•	Turn off notifications in your device settings.
	•	Limit analytics via your device privacy settings (where supported).

⸻

8. Children’s Privacy

LockFit is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country).
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can investigate and delete the information where appropriate.

⸻

9. International Transfers

Depending on the services we use (such as Firebase or RevenueCat), your data may be processed in countries outside your country of residence.

We take steps to ensure that any international data transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your data remains protected.

⸻

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:
	•	changes in the App,
	•	legal requirements, or
	•	technical or business developments.

When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
In the case of significant changes, we may also provide notice inside the app.
