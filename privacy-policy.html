    <h1>Privacy Policy – LockFit</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how LockFit (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the LockFit mobile application (the “App”).</p>
    <p>By using LockFit, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We aim to collect only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve the App.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide to us</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account-related information (if any):</strong> If the app allows you to create an account or save preferences, we may collect information such as your name or email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and support:</strong> If you contact us for support or send feedback (for example through in-app forms or our feedback tool FeatureBase), we collect the information you choose to share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>When you use LockFit, we may automatically collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App usage data:</strong> such as which screens you visit, features you use, and general interaction patterns (e.g. buttons tapped, session length).</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> such as device model, operating system version, app version, language, and country.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification and reminder settings:</strong> for example, your chosen exercise reminders, challenge schedules, or other timing preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is generally collected in an anonymized or aggregated way and does not directly identify you.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Camera Usage & Pose Detection (QuickPose)</h3>
    <p>Certain features of LockFit use your device’s camera to guide or track your exercises, including pose detection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We use third-party pose detection technology provided by <strong>QuickPose</strong> to analyze body position and count repetitions or track form.</li>
        <li>The camera is used only for the purpose of providing in-app functionality (e.g., tracking your posture or reps during an exercise).</li>
        <li>We do not store or transmit raw camera images or videos to our own servers.</li>
        <li>Any processing using the camera happens locally on your device or as part of QuickPose’s SDK, according to their own privacy practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Notifications</h3>
    <p>LockFit uses local and/or push notifications to remind you about planned exercise sessions, challenges, streaks, and other progress-related events. You can disable or adjust notification permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate app features (e.g., app blocking, exercise sessions, challenges, pose detection).</li>
        <li>Maintain and display your progress, challenge history, streaks, and stats.</li>
        <li>Improve app performance, stability, and user experience.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about updates, new features, or important changes (where applicable).</li>
        <li>Prevent abuse, detect technical issues, and ensure app security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>LockFit may offer premium features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Purchases and subscriptions are handled by <strong>Apple’s App Store</strong> billing system. We do not receive or store your full payment card information.</li>
        <li>We may receive limited information from Apple (such as transaction identifiers or subscription status) in order to unlock premium content and manage your access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscriptions and entitlements. RevenueCat processes purchase information to validate your purchases, manage active subscriptions, and determine whether you have access to premium features. Please refer to RevenueCat’s own privacy policy for more details.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use the following third-party services to help us operate and improve LockFit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (by Google):</strong> used for analytics, crash reporting, and cloud services such as databases or cloud storage related to the App. Firebase helps us understand app performance and stability.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> used to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions, validate receipts, and determine your access to premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>QuickPose (quickpose.ai):</strong> provides pose detection technology used to analyze body movements during exercises. QuickPose may process anonymized pose data (e.g., skeletal points) for the purpose of providing this functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>FeatureBase:</strong> used for user feedback, bug reports, and feature requests. This may include information such as your device type, app version, and any text or ratings you choose to submit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties process data in accordance with their own privacy policies and may act as independent controllers or processors of your data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain information only for as long as is necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide the App and its features,</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations,</li>
        <li>Resolve disputes, and</li>
        <li>Enforce our agreements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you stop using LockFit, we may retain anonymized or aggregated data for analytics and app improvement, but it can no longer be linked to you personally.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:</p>

        <li>Adjusting notification settings on your device.</li>
        <li>Using your device’s privacy settings (where available) to limit analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>LockFit is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can investigate and delete the information where appropriate.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Depending on the services we use (such as Firebase, RevenueCat, QuickPose, or FeatureBase), your data may be processed in countries other than your country of residence. We take steps to ensure that any international data transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your data remains protected.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or technical and business developments. When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. In the case of significant changes, we may also provide additional notice within the App.</p>
